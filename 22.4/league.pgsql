-- Design a schema for a simple sports league. Your schema should keep track of
--  - All of the teams in the league
--  - All of the goals scored by every player for each game
--  - All of the players in the league and their corresponding teams
--  - All of the referees who have been part of each game
--  - All of the matches played between teams
--  - All of the start and end dates for season that a league has
--  - The standings/rankings of each team in the league (This doesnâ€™t have to be its own table
--      if the data can be captured somehow).

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS league;
CREATE DATABASE league;
\c league;
