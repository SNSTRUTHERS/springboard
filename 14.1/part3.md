> Build a very simple HTML form that uses the `GET` method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.
> 
> Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it, explore in Chrome Developer tools how you can view the request and response headers.
> 
> Edit the page to change the form type to `POST`, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.
`GET` stores its form data in the query string. `POST` stores its form data in the request body.
